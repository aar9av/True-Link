I bet you didn’t know this, 
My recent project, True Link, is a dating platform where users can find their perfect partner. 💕 I am sure that you all know how all dating apps work. 
What makes True Link different from other dating platforms like Finder and Humble? All the features are similar to traditional dating apps, but the main difference is our anonymous post-confession section, where users can confess something without revealing their identity. 🕵️‍♂️
Everyone tries to find 🔍 your partner, and if someone knows him/her, they can tag them to connect with you. 
Wo kehte hain na “Agar kisi cheez ko shiddat se chaho to poori kaynaat use tumse milwane me lag jati hai.” 🌌
